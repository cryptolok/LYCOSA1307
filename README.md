# LYCOSA 1307
CypherPunk city-specific challenges with epic loot

These challenges will test your knowledge and skills in mathematics, cryptology, reverse-engineering, steganology, compression and encoding

They will also require some intuition

This is an excellent opportunity for learning those disciplines and producing some dopamine

## The challenges

Following the success of Cicada 3307 challenges, my CryptoTrooper challenge and other various CTFs that I maid, I decided to make a city-specific CypherPunk CTF with a special reward (loot)

Each year it will be in a different city(ies) and (maybe) at a different date

For 2017 - it's Paris (France)

Everyone can participate, but to get the actual loot, you will have to go to a specific location, which depends on the city

This year the prize is a customized, very secure and very fast 1024-bit symmetric block cipher that is used by a very small group of cypherpunks, similar to ChaCha and Salsa20

### Notes

Regarding the "start-up" status and the difficulty of the challenges, more hints can be published and changes (even for loot) can be made, so don't hesitate to contact me
